# Bitcoin Price Predictor Bot
A Telegram-ready project that predicts the next day's Bitcoin price using historical data and machine learning.
It also integrates with GPT to generate text-based posts and insights.

In addition, the project includes a fully deployed Telegram bot that runs in real time to automate market analysis, educational content, and BTC price forecasts for the channel [@realquietwhale](https://t.me/realquietwhale).
Posts are scheduled and generated daily using AI and up-to-date financial data.
